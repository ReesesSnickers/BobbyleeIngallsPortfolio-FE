# Bobbylee Ingalls Portfolio
This project is a [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) project. The project is ment to show my skills as a developer by providing a visual aid for recruiters, co-workers, friends, family, etc.

### Scripts
##### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if I make a edit and I will also see any lint errors in the console.
##### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.Since I host this app using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), the pipeline will take care of any builds.
